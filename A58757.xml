            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEing ſo long ſilent, (occaſioned as you ſhall another time hear) I could not in Modeſty have troubled you with this, had not both your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, (which yeſterday by accident I came to know) and the new as well as ſtrange Diſcovery I give you an account of, been powerful Interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but ſhortly you ſhall hear from me. Therefore without troubling you any further, know, That about a year ſince, there was ſome ſmall Diſcovery made againſt the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> in relation to a Plot in <hi>Munſter:</hi> On which he attended the Councel, and was for ſome time confined to his Chamber; but there being but one Witneſs, he was diſmiſſed his attendance for that time. Since then, on Thurſday laſt, he was committed to the Caſtle, on new Evidence, for the former Buſineſs. There is one <hi>Bourke, Mac-Nemarre,</hi> and <hi>Fanagan,</hi> come in as Evidences againſt him; all ſpeak much to the ſame purport, and the effect of all is, That he had engaged the Province of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Roman</hi> Party) in the Cauſe, and in a ſhort time doubted not to ſecure many others. The Caſtle and City of <hi>Limerick</hi> was to have been betrayed, and after this manner: There were to be Five hundred, beſides a Party in the City, Three Hundred whereof were to be lodged in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Town without the Gates, and the other two hundred to be plac'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently near the Caſtle, and in the morning when the Trevally beat, (at which time the Town-folks were preſumed to be drowſie, and in their Beds) the three hundred were to enter into the City, and on the Alarm, their Party within were to cut the Proteſtants Throats, and make themſelves Maſters of the City: And the other two hundred were plac'd as aforeſaid, to prevent any Succour from the Caſtle, and were likewiſe to endeavour the Surprize of that; and all this for the dear ſake of the <hi>French</hi> King, who was to have Landed in the great River of <hi>Shanon</hi> with an Army. Thus far all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes agree; but <hi>Mac-Nemarre,</hi> who appears to be an Ingenuous perſon, goes farther, and produced a Liſt (as he ſays from the Earl) of a hundred of the principal perſons concerned, and ſaid (as I am informed) in Councel, If he made not out his Allegations, he would be content to have his Throat cut. He alſo gave an account how he became firſt concerned, being thus: The Earl taking him one day into his Lordſhips Garden, informed him that he had a buſineſs of great Weight to impart to him, and knew no perſon ſo qualified for ſuch an Undertaking as he was. And after promiſing him great Rewards, and propoſing a way how he ſhould not only get, but ſecure a conſiderable Eſtate; He was wrought upon, and did declare his readineſs to ſerve his Lordſhip in any thing, to the utmoſt extent both of his Life and Fortune. Whereupon his Lordſhip informed him of the whole Deſign of bringing in the <hi>French</hi> King, and laid open the feaſibleneſs of the thing: And <hi>Mac-Nemarre</hi> demanding, how they could deal with the Proteſtants, they being generally

               <!-- PDF PAGE 9 -->well furniſht with Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and able to make a conſiderable defence; he ſaid, That his Party were about, and hoped in a ſhort time to effect the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Servants in all Proteſtant Houſes, eſpecially in <hi>Munster,</hi> and theſe Servants either to deliver againſt ſuch a day, the Keys, with the ſtamp in Clay, or fire the Houſes; and ſaid, In bringing in the <hi>French</hi> King, he would deſire only Eſtates to be ſecured for him and his Adherents, and the reſt of the Kingdom as the <hi>Monſieur</hi> thought fit, and by that means ſaid, he hoped to be revenged on that K— and enemy of his, <hi>Ormond</hi> his Son <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and the Knave <hi>Villers;</hi> (who you may remember had a Suit with him.) This is all I can yet learn of this Affair, only that one <hi>Reyly,</hi> (as I remember) Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net to the D. <hi>O.</hi> Troop, is ſo far engaged in the Buſineſs, as to have a promiſe from the Earl to be a Major, a large ſtep, if he overſtride not himſelf. I hear of a new Witneſs this day come in againſt the Earl. Likewiſe there is one <hi>Plunket,</hi> titular Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> committed, on the former Proclamation for Papiſts departing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
